	<h5>Rickey Chang, recipient of 2016 HAW Education Award</h5>

	<p><img src="news/images/RickeyChang.jpg" alt="Rickey Chang" class ="content-img"  width="600" height="400"></p> <p>"Although the HAW Educational Scholarship awarded me a monetary value, the award itself meant much more than that. Winning the HAW Scholarship was my way to show the Hmong community that we can achieve. As a boy, I believed that college was only a dream. It seemed like a story being told that you could always picture but never experience. After years of hard work, I can say that the dream can be experienced, just as I have experienced mine. I would not have been able to achieve these accomplishments without support, such as the HAW Education Award." Rickey is currently continuing his education at Western Washington University where he plans on graduating in Fall of 2017. He is currently working towards finishing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Psychology. After graduation, he plans on pursuing a nursing career in order to apply his skills to help people in need. </p>

	<p>"One of the most important things a community can give to their future generations is educational support and that is exactly what the HAW scholarship is all about.</P>

	The scholarship helped pay for my summer internship class with Americorps and their Hunger Campaign across King County. At Western Washington University, summer tuition is less expensive than the school year, but is mostly paid out of the student's pocket due to depleted funds during the year. Though the internship was paid and I spent the weekends helping my family at the farmer's markets, the scholarship relieved much of the financial burden I had that summer. </P>

	<P>The internship class that the scholarship helped paid for gave me the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom and in my community. I worked with many low-income families in my hometown of Federal Way where I could make a direct impact to improving their lives. I learned valuable lessons I am continuing to build on. </P>

	<P>I graduated this June with debt lower than the national average of $30,000 thanks to the HAW scholarship. My internship has significantly improved my job selection and made my resume competitive. My work with Western Hmong Student Association and Americorps has reaffirmed my passion for helping minority students attain higher education. I plan to continue this work and serve my community as best I can where ever my career takes me. </P>

	<P>I want to thank my mom, sister, grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles for their support."
	Michaela graduated from Western Washington University this June 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Multidisciplinary Studies, with a focus in Journalism. She minors in both  Public Relations and Internet Resource Creation and Management. She also holds a Content Development certificate.</P>
	<b>William Yang, recipient of 2016 HAW Education Award </b> "The HAW scholarship helped improve my chances of attending college since money was always a problem. Currently, I am not certain of which career path I want to follow, but I am looking to go towards the medical or psychology field. The education that I have received so far has helped me improve my own personal life and to be able to educate people that do not understand some aspects of life such as why people have different behaviors or to just simply explain why people have different perspectives in life.
