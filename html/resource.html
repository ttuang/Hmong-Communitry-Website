			<h5>Rickey Chang, recipient of 2016 HAW Education Award</h5>

			<p><img src="news/images/RickeyChang.jpg" alt="Rickey Chang" class ="content-img"  width="600" height="400"></p> <p>"Although the HAW Educational Scholarship awarded me a monetary value, the award itself meant much more than that. Winning the HAW Scholarship was my way to show the Hmong community that we can achieve. As a boy, I believed that college was only a dream. It seemed like a story being told that you could always picture but never experience. After years of hard work, I can say that the dream can be experienced, just as I have experienced mine. I would not have been able to achieve these accomplishments without support, such as the HAW Education Award." Rickey is currently continuing his education at Western Washington University where he plans on graduating in Fall of 2017. He is currently working towards finishing a Bachelor's of Science degree in Psychology. After graduation, he plans on pursuing a nursing career in order to apply his skills to help people in need. </p>

			<p>"One of the most important things a community can give to their future generations is educational support and that is exactly what the HAW scholarship is all about.</P>

			The scholarship helped pay for my summer internship class with Americorps and their Hunger Campaign across King County. At Western Washington University, summer tuition is less expensive than the school year, but is mostly paid out of the student's pocket due to depleted funds during the year. Though the internship was paid and I spent the weekends helping my family at the farmer's markets, the scholarship relieved much of the financial burden I had that summer. </P>

			<P>The internship class that the scholarship helped paid for gave me the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom and in my community. I worked with many low-income families in my hometown of Federal Way where I could make a direct impact to improving their lives. I learned valuable lessons I am continuing to build on. </P>

			<P>I graduated this June with debt lower than the national average of $30,000 thanks to the HAW scholarship. My internship has significantly improved my job selection and made my resume competitive. My work with Western Hmong Student Association and Americorps has reaffirmed my passion for helping minority students attain higher education. I plan to continue this work and serve my community as best I can where ever my career takes me. </P>

			<P>I want to thank my mom, sister, grandma, grandpa, aunts and uncles for their support."
			Michaela graduated from Western Washington University this June 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Multidisciplinary Studies, with a focus in Journalism. She minors in both  Public Relations and Internet Resource Creation and Management. She also holds a Content Development certificate.</P>
			<b>William Yang, recipient of 2016 HAW Education Award </b> "The HAW scholarship helped improve my chances of attending college since money was always a problem. Currently, I am not certain of which career path I want to follow, but I am looking to go towards the medical or psychology field. The education that I have received so far has helped me improve my own personal life and to be able to educate people that do not understand some aspects of life such as why people have different behaviors or to just simply explain why people have different perspectives in life.

			<div id="flip7">* Guaranteed Tuition for Qualifying College-Bound 8th Grade Students</div>
			<div id="panel7">
			<p>Did you know that the State of Washington will guarantee tuition to a Washington public college or university to any student on the federal free and reduced lunch program - if that student maintains a 2.0 grade point average and does not commit a felony during high school? It's true. But they have to enroll in the scholarship program by the 8th grade. And the deadline is almost here. It's called the College Bound Scholarship Program, and our goal is for 100 percent of eligible 8th graders in Seattle to be enrolled in the College Bound Scholarship program by the June 30, 2012 deadline. Last year Mayor Mike McGinn's office was able to help meet that goal by getting the word out in the community about this incredible opportunity. In fact, last year 42% more kids signed up than in 2010. We need to step up and take responsibility as a city to help our children, especially when many families cannot afford to send their kids to college. Even if you don't have a child who qualifies, you probably know someone who does. Please share the above information and the following link as widely as possible. Students may apply for the College Bound Scholarship online at: http://hecb.wa.gov/collegebound For more information on this program, download the FAQs document: College Bound Scholarship FAQs

			<div id="flip8">* Focus on Education and Youth</div>
			<div id="panel8">
			<p>Truancy and Delinquency is a problem in our community that has been overlooked for a long time. It is something families do not like to mention outside of the immediate family. Parents feel helpless to control their children. Their children do not listen to the parents. Yet, parents feel uneasy to seek external help. It is a problem that many of us in the community do not want to bring up, but it exists, and it needs to be addressed. It may not be your child, but it is someone's child. The cultural expectation is to not intrude on a family's problem unless they ask for help, but they do not ask for help. It has been brought to our attention that there is a need for help in this area. How can we help?
